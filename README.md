Hi, I’m @NathanaelSpecht!

Go to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/nspecht12/) for my most recent work. I keep my Github up for historical reasons, so don't expect me to post anything new here.

<!---
NathanaelSpecht/NathanaelSpecht is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) 
appears on your GitHub profile. You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
